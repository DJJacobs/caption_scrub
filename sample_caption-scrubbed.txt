People share varying statistics regarding
employment rates for people who are deaf.

It ranges from 50% to 75%.
But what is the actual employment rate?

The actual employment rate may 
not apply to all deaf people.

For example, women, people of color, 
and those with additional disabilities

may have a different experience.

>> A welder. 
>> A teacher.

>> Filmmaker.
>> Personal Trainer.

>> A yoga instructor
>> Dentist.

>> Mechanic.
>> Teaching for the Deaf and Blind.

>> I'm a researcher.
>> I'm an advocate.

[TEXT: Let’s look at some national data.]

>> A University of Texas at Austin
research team analyzed a sample

collected from the US census bureau.
The sample considers only individuals

ages 21-65 or “working age” 
to exclude those retired

and those still pursuing education.

Using this data they pinpointed 
the actual unemployment rates

for hearing individual and 
deaf individuals.

72% of Hearing individuals are 
working whereas 48%

of deaf individuals are working.

Of those not working, the federal
government identified 2 categories.

The first is unemployment meaning
people who are actively searching

for a job and need assistance. 
The second category is called

Not in Labor Force and are those
not interested in working meaning

they have maybe retired early, 
be at home raising a family

or seeking additional education.

Recall that unemployment means
actively searching for work.

When considering the unemployment 
rates for the entire country there is not

a large discrepancy between the 
general US hearing population

and deaf individuals. 
[TEXT 4.9% and 4.6%]

Now remember that the
Not in Labor force category

includes individuals that are
not in the job market or not

actively seeking work. 
In this category, the numbers are

drastically different.

23% of hearing people 
whereas 47% of those deaf.

There are 5 subcategories 
to the Not In Labor Force

category. This includes
women, veterans,

Native Americans, African Americans, 
and deaf disabled.

Some of these individuals may have been
unsuccessful in finding employment

or may have been unsatisfied with 
their work opportunities.

These individuals have a variety of 
experiences and reasons for not working.

>> It’s a big challenge and 
quite frustrating.

A number of the barriers exist 
because the general public think

Deaf Blind people aren’t
able to do things.

>> I would be under a lot of stress.

>> Everything needs to be instantaneous.
Communication needs to happen

on the fly.

>> They didn't know how best 
to communicate.

For my employer and manager,
writing messages was a struggle,

so I quit.

>> When it comes to doing my last
minute things, with my disability

I can’t do last minute things.

>> They see that I’m Deaf and a girl,
they think I can’t do the job.

>> Employers don't want to pay
interpreting expenses

because they're costly.

>> Generally there's a lack of experience 
working with deaf people.

There's fewer opportunities.

There's a common misconception 
that deaf individuals earn less than

their hearing counterparts. 
This actually isn’t true,

the average salary for both groups
working full time is $52,000.

Hearing females earn $.82 to every $1
that a hearing male earns.

And deaf females earn $.76 compared
to each $1 a deaf male earns.

Being Deaf with an additional Disability 
I face more difficulties. 

If one has a physical disability, 
a visible disability, it frightens employers,

and leads them to not hire
that disabled person.

If one has an invisible disability, 
that you can't see,

such as ADHD or the like, 
the person with that type

of disability & normally 
doesn’t disclose that.

But, when it is found out and realized 
the individual may need

accommodations,& and that 
can take more time.

For me it wasn't hard finding a job, 
it was more that I couldn't keep the job.

It is hard finding a job, 
it's no joke.

Deaf individuals have an employment 
rate of 63% whereas individuals that

are deaf with additional disabilities
are employed at a rate of 32%

and earn less.

Across the U.S. there are discrepancies
in pay for people of color and this

is true for individuals 
who are deaf as well.

For example, people who are Latino
work more that those who are white,

but they earn significantly less.

It’s important to understand that 
employment experiences are not

the same for all &individuals 
who are deaf.

Each has their own identity, 
experience and needs.

The community should address this
diversity through support

and collaboration.

We hope to see the development 
of job training, the chance to apply

for jobs, greater job opportunities 
for deaf people, the ability to

show our skills, and greater
communication access.

Those are key.
