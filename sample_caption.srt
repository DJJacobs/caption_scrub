00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:20,038
People share varying statistics regarding
employment rates for people who are deaf.

3
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:26,245
It ranges from 50% to 75%.
But what is the actual employment rate?

4
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,226
The actual employment rate may 
not apply to all deaf people.

5
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:40,242
For example, women, people of color, 
and those with additional disabilities

6
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:42,452
may have a different experience.

7
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,563
&gt;&gt; A welder. 
&gt;&gt; A teacher.

8
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:51,363
&gt;&gt; Filmmaker.
&gt;&gt; Personal Trainer.

9
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,556
&gt;&gt; A yoga instructor
&gt;&gt; Dentist.

10
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,075
&gt;&gt; Mechanic.
&gt;&gt; Teaching for the Deaf and Blind.

11
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,166
&gt;&gt; I'm a researcher.
&gt;&gt; I'm an advocate.

12
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:02,088
[TEXT: Let’s look at some national data.]

13
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,207
&gt;&gt; A University of Texas at Austin
research team analyzed a sample

14
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:11,308
collected from the US census bureau.
The sample considers only individuals

15
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:17,011
ages 21-65 or “working age” 
to exclude those retired

16
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,452
and those still pursuing education.

17
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:30,082
Using this data they pinpointed 
the actual unemployment rates

18
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:32,426
for hearing individual and 
deaf individuals.

19
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,472
72% of Hearing individuals are 
working whereas 48%

20
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,116
of deaf individuals are working.

21
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:42,682
Of those not working, the federal
government identified 2 categories.

22
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,409
The first is unemployment meaning
people who are actively searching

23
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,197
for a job and need assistance. 
The second category is called

24
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:54,644
Not in Labor Force and are those
not interested in working meaning

25
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:58,481
they have maybe retired early, 
be at home raising a family

26
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:01,087
or seeking additional education.

27
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:09,277
Recall that unemployment means
actively searching for work.

28
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,150
When considering the unemployment 
rates for the entire country there is not

29
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,738
a large discrepancy between the 
general US hearing population

30
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:19,879
and deaf individuals. 
[TEXT 4.9% and 4.6%]

31
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:27,258
Now remember that the
Not in Labor force category

32
00:02:27,258 --> 00:02:30,629
includes individuals that are
not in the job market or not

33
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:33,790
actively seeking work. 
In this category, the numbers are

34
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,338
drastically different.

35
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:39,661
23% of hearing people 
whereas 47% of those deaf.

36
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:48,593
There are 5 subcategories 
to the Not In Labor Force

37
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:52,013
category. This includes
women, veterans,

38
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:56,688
Native Americans, African Americans, 
and deaf disabled.

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,451
Some of these individuals may have been
unsuccessful in finding employment

40
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,696
or may have been unsatisfied with 
their work opportunities.

41
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:10,089
These individuals have a variety of 
experiences and reasons for not working.

42
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,593
&gt;&gt; It’s a big challenge and 
quite frustrating.

43
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:19,298
A number of the barriers exist 
because the general public think

44
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:22,178
Deaf Blind people aren’t
able to do things.

45
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:24,951
&gt;&gt; I would be under a lot of stress.

46
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,471
&gt;&gt; Everything needs to be instantaneous.
Communication needs to happen

47
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:29,831
on the fly.

48
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,380
&gt;&gt; They didn't know how best 
to communicate.

49
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:35,445
For my employer and manager,
writing messages was a struggle,

50
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:36,905
so I quit.

51
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,981
&gt;&gt; When it comes to doing my last
minute things, with my disability

52
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,813
I can’t do last minute things.

53
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:50,518
&gt;&gt; They see that I’m Deaf and a girl,
they think I can’t do the job.

54
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,437
&gt;&gt; Employers don't want to pay
interpreting expenses

55
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:54,690
because they're costly.

56
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:57,724
&gt;&gt; Generally there's a lack of experience 
working with deaf people.

57
00:03:57,724 --> 00:03:59,583
There's fewer opportunities.

58
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:07,589
There's a common misconception 
that deaf individuals earn less than

59
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:10,355
their hearing counterparts. 
This actually isn’t true,

60
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:14,208
the average salary for both groups
working full time is $52,000.

61
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,952
Hearing females earn $.82 to every $1
that a hearing male earns.

62
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:31,749
And deaf females earn $.76 compared
to each $1 a deaf male earns.

63
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:42,119
Being Deaf with an additional Disability 
I face more difficulties. 

64
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:47,864
If one has a physical disability, 
a visible disability, it frightens employers,

65
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:51,165
and leads them to not hire
that disabled person.

66
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:56,483
If one has an invisible disability, 
that you can't see,

67
00:04:56,483 --> 00:05:03,083
such as ADHD or the like, 
the person with that type

68
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:07,142
of disability &amp; normally 
doesn’t disclose that.

69
00:05:10,638 --> 00:05:16,317
But, when it is found out and realized 
the individual may need

70
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:20,514
accommodations,&amp; and that 
can take more time.

71
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,139
For me it wasn't hard finding a job, 
it was more that I couldn't keep the job.

72
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:34,310
It is hard finding a job, 
it's no joke.

73
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,149
Deaf individuals have an employment 
rate of 63% whereas individuals that

74
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:45,150
are deaf with additional disabilities
are employed at a rate of 32%

75
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,360
and earn less.

76
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:56,189
Across the U.S. there are discrepancies
in pay for people of color and this

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,967
is true for individuals 
who are deaf as well.

78
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:14,412
For example, people who are Latino
work more that those who are white,

79
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:17,425
but they earn significantly less. misspellings

80
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,466
It’s important to understand that 
employment experiences are not

81
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,903
the same for all &amp;individuals 
who are deaf.

82
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:38,494
Each has their own identity, 
experience and needs.

83
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:41,964
The community should address this
diversity through support

84
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:43,497
and collaboration.

85
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,775
We hope to see the development 
of job training, the chance to apply

86
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:09,045
for jobs, greater job opportunities 
for deaf people, the ability to

87
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:12,903
show our skills, and greater
communication access.

88
00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:14,348
Those are key.
